# Gemini-Pro-Python-Laboratory
This code is a Python program that creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for chatting with Gemini-Pro, a chatbot developed by Google. The GUI includes a welcome label, a chat history text box, a user input entry box, a send button, and a clear button. The chat history and user input entry box are styled with custom fonts and colors.

To use this code:

1. Save the code as a file with a `.py` extension, such as `chatbot.py`.
2. Install the required Python libraries using the `pip` command:
```
pip install tkinter google.generativeai IPython
```
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.
4. Run the following command to start the GUI:
```
python chatbot.py
```
5. The GUI will open, and you can start chatting with Gemini-Pro by typing your messages in the user input entry box and clicking the send button.

A screenshot of the GUI is attached below:
